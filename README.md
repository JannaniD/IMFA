# IMFA
Integrated Multi Factor Authentication System 

The IMFA (Integrated Multi-Factor Authentication) system is a security solution designed to provide a high level of protection for sensitive data and applications. The 4 level authentication system provides an effective and secure way of protecting sensitive information and data. The use of multiple levels of authentication provides a robust defense against various types of attacks, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.

## Levels in IMFA
The four levels which we provide are:

~ Random generated 4-digit text password

~ Mobile-to-web cross-login using QR code authentication

~ Smart Card authentication

~ Mobile-to-web cross-login using Fingerprint 

## Level 1
The first level of authentication, password-based authentication, provides a basic level of security. The usual passwords can be easily compromised, and this level of authentication can be bypassed. We overcome this limitation as we use the type of password where the user need not to remember the password at all. 

## Level 2
The second level, which involves mobile-to-web cross-login using QR code, provides an added layer of security by requiring the user to have access to their mobile device and scanning a QR code to log in.

## Level 3
The third level, which involves smart card authentication using RFID, adds an additional layer of security by requiring a physical device that must be present to authenticate. This level of authentication is more secure than password-based authentication and mobile-to-web cross-login using QR code.

## Level 4
The fourth level, which involves facial recognition authentication, which provides the highest level of security in this authentication system. The use of facial authentication is a highly secure method of authentication and provides an additional layer of security against various types of attacks.

Overall, the 4 level authentication system discussed in this project is a highly secure and effective way of protecting sensitive information and data. The use of multiple levels of authentication provides a robust defense against various types of attacks, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information.
